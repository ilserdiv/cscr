# 🇵🇭 Philippine Civil Service Review Website

This is a **personal study website** I’m building to help myself prepare for the **Philippine Civil Service Assessment Test**. The goal is to organize lessons, quizzes, and helpful references in one accessible place — a tool I can use daily to review and track my progress.

While the site is primarily for my own learning, I’m also designing it with future flexibility in mind. As it grows, it could become useful to others preparing for the same exam.
